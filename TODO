Fixs:
    * Make it work to download a file with only one click, I don't know why
      with text files I need to click several times to open it... Maybe we
      should show a "save as" dialog to save the file instead of trying to
      open with xdg-open.

    * Ignore launched threads when changing room...
    * Sort rooms by last message or fav?

Functionality:
    * Show event messages in message list
    * Register
    * Room creation
    * Change user display name
    * Change user avatar
    * Store last read message to show differently

Events to manage:
    * Join / leave from current user
    * Invite event
